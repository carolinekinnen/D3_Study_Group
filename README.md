##D3 Resources 

NPR's collection of D3 visualization templates. Not always great code, but well-tested and covers a range of responsive options. https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics-templates/  


Aaron Williams at the Post has been posting about his workflow using D3 and Observable to prototype visualizations - https://twitter.com/aboutaaron/status/1107697344944975872 

 Thomas Wilburn book about doing dataviz and interactive journalism without using libraries like D3

@observablehq is my go-to tool for quickly sketching ideas w/o a full dev setup. I was able to share sketches (privately!) and iterate as the story and designed evolved. Both graphics started as forks of a notebook I use for almost all my Observable work https://observablehq.com/@aboutaaron/setup-page
